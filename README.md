# Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Oliver. [![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/user/018afeda-bf0b-4453-91d1-88704559e127.svg)](https://wakatime.com/@018afeda-bf0b-4453-91d1-88704559e127)

I am a compsci and philosophy student. My public repos mostly consist of various
small quality-of-life improvements for solving niche issues i've come accross.
Such as [nostalgeez](https://github.com/orjahren/nostalgeez) for finding out
what song i listened to on _this exact day $x$ years ago_ or the ["remove AI
summaries"](https://github.com/orjahren/remove-ai-summaries) Chromium extension
that leads the fight againt brain atrophy (AKA brain rot).

My WIP masters thesis is located [here on
Github](https://github.com/orjahren/master) and it is about using AI to enhance
autonomous driving systems.

I fund my studies by working as a software developer in the [research service
sector](https://nettskjema.no/). Feel free to see [my
portofolio](https://rustejahren.no) or
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/orjahren).
