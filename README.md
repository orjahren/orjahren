# Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Oliver.

I am a compsci and philosophy student.

My WIP masters thesis is located [here on
Github](https://github.com/orjahren/master) and it is about using AI to enhance
autonomous driving systems.

I fund my studies by working as a software developer in the [research service
sector](https://nettskjema.no/). Feel free to see [my portofolio](https://rustejahren.no) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/orjahren).

You can reach me on [oliverrj@ifi.uio.no](mailto://oliverrj@ifi.uio.no).
